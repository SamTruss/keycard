# Changelog

All notable changes to keycard are documented here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and versioning follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) — see
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#releasing) for how a release is cut.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.2] - 2026-08-07

### Fixed

- README still said "Pre-alpha. Not released, not usable yet" and told
  installers to run `pipx install keycard-ssh` "once released" — baked into
  the 0.1.1 tag before that release actually shipped to PyPI, so the
  published package description contradicted itself. No functional changes.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-08-07

### Added

- SSH server with public-key authentication, username-to-room resolution at
  auth time, PTY allocation, and window-resize propagation.
- Built-in rooms (`ubuntu`, `python`, `node`) that work with zero config,
  plus an optional `keycard.toml` for custom rooms and a default-room
  fallback for unrecognised usernames.
- Per-room resource caps (memory, CPU, pids) and network isolation
  (`network = "none"`).
- Idle-timeout reaper: a room with no traffic in either direction for
  `idle_timeout` is destroyed automatically.
- `--keep` / `keep_window`: pause a room on a dropped connection instead of
  destroying it, and let the same username reconnect and resume it within
  the window.
- Graceful server shutdown: on SIGINT/SIGTERM, stop accepting new
  connections, give active sessions `shutdown_grace` to finish on their
  own, then close out whatever's left.
- `keycard rooms` to list configured environments; ASCII banners on the
  operator console and in the SSH session itself.
- A man page (`man/keycard.1`).

### Fixed

- Containers no longer survive a dropped connection: teardown polls
  container state instead of blocking on `container.wait()`, with a grace
  period and kill fallback, and is idempotent under concurrent triggers
  (client exit, connection drop, idle reap, and shutdown can all race).
